### `Scenario`: 
Imagine that you work at a company that is planning to migrate their on-prem historical and data sources to a data lakes solution. Initially, the data that will be ingested into the data lake will come from the below locations:
Internet of Things (IoT) sensors that send real-time data
A database with historical records
Supplemental data from third-party entities for enriching internally generated data
A live database with a semi-realtime data update.
The company has tasked you with
designing solutions for ingesting this data into their data lake, and each
location will need its ingestion solution. From there, you will need to also
design a solution for how to clean or transform the data so that it can be
analyzed. The company currently uses Apache Hadoop-based software. When
possible, they prefer to use similar technologies in the cloud so that they
donâ€™t need to retrain their analytics team on too many new technologies at one
time. The company also has a requirement to create dashboards that show visual
representations of the insights they derive from the data.

### `Task` :
1. Create a high-level architecture diagram that uses an AWS service icon and arrows to depict an AWS Solution for the given scenario.
2. A written explanation including migration plan.

### `Notes`:
- Diagram.md -> Draw diagram by markdown + explanation
- Architecture.drawio -> Draw diagram by draw io
- Solution.md -> Explain `AWS Solution` and `Migration plan`
