## `AWS Solution`:

  The solution uses a variety of AWS services to ingest and process data from various sources into a data lake. The IoT sensor data is ingested using AWS IoT Core, and then sent to AWS Kinesis Data Firehose for data transformation and loading into the data lake. The historical data from the on-premises database is migrated to an AWS RDS instance, and then sent to AWS Glue ETL jobs for cleaning and transformation before being loaded into the data lake. The third-party data is ingested through AWS Data Exchange and sent to AWS Glue ETL jobs for further processing before being loaded into the data lake.

  Once the data is ingested and transformed, it is stored in the data lake using AWS S3. AWS Athena is used for querying the data lake and extracting insights. AWS QuickSight is used for creating visual dashboards to present the insights.

## `Migration Plan`:

1. The migration plan involves the following steps:

2. Evaluate the current infrastructure and identify data sources: The first step is to evaluate the current infrastructure and identify all the data sources that need to be migrated to the data lake.

3. Set up AWS accounts and services: The second step is to set up the necessary AWS accounts and services for the migration. This includes setting up AWS IoT Core, AWS Kinesis Data Firehose, AWS RDS, AWS Data Exchange, AWS Glue, AWS S3, AWS Athena, and AWS QuickSight.

4. Migrate historical data: The historical data from the on-premises database will be migrated to an AWS RDS instance. This can be done using the AWS Database Migration Service.

5. Ingest real-time data: The IoT sensor data will be ingested using AWS IoT Core.

6. Ingest third-party data: The third-party data will be ingested through AWS Data Exchange.

7. Transform and load data: The data from all sources will be sent to AWS Glue ETL jobs for cleaning and transformation. The transformed data will then be loaded into the data lake using AWS S3.

8. Query data and create dashboards: AWS Athena will be used for querying the data lake and extracting insights. AWS QuickSight will be used for creating visual dashboards to present the insights.

9. Test and validate: The final step is to test and validate the solution to ensure that it meets the requirements and is working correctly.
